/data/uqhmcdou/paralleltest/example_slurmjob.py:44: UserWarning: There are not enough devices to run parallel chains: expected 2 but got 1. Chains will be drawn sequentially. If you are running MCMC in CPU, consider using `numpyro.set_host_device_count(2)` at the beginning of your program. You can double-check how many devices are available in your system using `jax.local_device_count()`.
